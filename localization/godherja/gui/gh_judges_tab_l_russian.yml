 FAITH_JUDGES: "Codices"
 FAITH_JUDGES_EXPLANATION: "The Hubarite [faith|E] has been overseen by a system of [magi|E]-judges since time immemorial, their divine wisdom guiding the faithful through thick and thin. During the countless millennia, however, some of these solar custodians and their legal teachings have become legends unto themselves, and their brilliant insights on law and justice remain prevalent to this day.\n\nPossessing complimentary [traits|E] to a chosen legal code will increase its benefits, capped by how advanced it is, but a character cannot pick a code unless they pass its difficulty threshold."
