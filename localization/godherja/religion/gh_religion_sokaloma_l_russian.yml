 sokaloma_religion_desc: "To those that venerate the Sokaloma or 'sky dance' each star represents a person's past and future being, believing that when one dies they leave behind their previous soul among the sky, in order to be reincarnated from the very same matter. Sokalomans hold that this fabric of consciousness manifests itself into figures which are more akin to traditional deities, represented by the various constellations of the night sky. Therefore to worshippers of the sky dance, the distinction between god and human is blurred and oftentimes unnecessary as each person will be and has been a god.\n\nIn this system the gods did not precede or create humanity, instead the gods are humanity. Each deity functioning as the collective spirit of their devotees, past, present and future.  Through a series of arcane divinations and cosmological examinations, each child is ascribed to one of these gods, which they are expected to follow and let guide them, for as long as there are stars in the night sky."

 sokaloma_desc: "The Sokaloma is the traditional faith of the Takopara, a belief system which holds that the stars are the fundamental element to human existence.  To those that venerate the Sokaloma or 'sky dance' each star represents a person's past and future being, believing that when one dies they leave behind their previous soul among the sky, in order to be reincarnated from the very same matter. Sokalomans hold that this fabric of consciousness manifests itself into figures which are more akin to traditional deities, represented by the various constellations of the night sky. One's fate and guardian spirits are determined at birth through complex astrological rituals only understood through years of meticulous study. "
