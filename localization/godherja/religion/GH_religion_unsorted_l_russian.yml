Rebels to the ancient Mountain-Sun Temple and then the proto-[aversarians|E], the Odyr's rose in 65, 87, and 109 respectively. To this day it is hotly debated whether the Odyr's were related, took the former's names out of respect, or if Odyr was some sort of ancient title from a single culture.\n\nRegardless, the Odyr's proved to be shrewd administrators and warriors both, each staging significant rebellions to whichever realm they lived under despite harsh retribution. Odyrians believe that the Odyr's were reincarnations of the ancient god Odyranon, and that one day a final 'Odyr Thorm' will rise and retake the throne of heaven to lead all peoples. While over a dozen false Odyr's have risen over the centuries since Odyr Hune, none have ever proven themselves worthy of the title."

Follower doctrine claims that there are twenty major gods and eighty spirits and demons, and their esoteric methods are far too complicated and intricate for anyone to understand unless they have dedicated themselves to studying them. Followers believe that nobody but one who understands them may rule, and historically the Mountain-Sun Temple was entirely ruled by a theocratic class of monastic orders, the chief one located at the [GetBuilding('vounill_01').GetName] itself.\n\nWhen the Mountain-Sun Temple, both the religion and the realm, were conquered by the [aversarians|E], many of their beliefs and structures were incorporated into their religion.
