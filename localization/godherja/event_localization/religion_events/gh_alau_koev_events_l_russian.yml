 alau_koev.0001.t: "The Festival of Fire"
 alau_koev.0001.desc: "Alau Pyesali, the Festival of Fire, is the highest act of devotion an Alau Koevar can attend short of reopening the [fire_gate|E]. I have chosen to prostrate myself before the Great Flame in attendance to show my loyalty to Alau Koev and the realm beyond it. It is a harsh pilgrimage to the mountains where they are held, but it is a necessary hardship.\n\nDozens of hopeful chosen gather in the huts along the mountain's spine, cloaked in faded reds and blacks in the manner of the original priesthood. I pass all manner of would-be champions of the faith on my journey to the summit. And yet is I who is called to the Great Flame to touch the heat with my flesh."
 alau_koev.0001.a: "A high honor."
 alau_koev.0001.b: "I will not sear my skin off for the pleasure of priests!"
  
 alau_koev.0002.t: "Before the Great Flame"
 alau_koev.0002.desc: "I take my place at the peak of the stairs, quickly pulled into a stone hut by figures I do not recognise. The Great Flame shimmers before me in a smoky room, beckoning me take another step into its pyre. The priests huddle around its warmth with seared skin and missing limbs. I am offered a knife by the cloaked figure nearest to, his hollow socket glaring back at me in the flickering torchlight.\n\nSurrounded by the priesthood, I cannot escape my divine duty now. I could place my hand onto the flame for a moment, risking injury but saving my pious reputation. On the other hand, I could take the offered knife and give a part of myself to the fire–such an act would no doubt please the zealots around me. Neither would be safe, but surely the glory of [alau_koev|E] is worth the pain?"
 alau_koev.0002.a: "All it would take is a single touch..."
 alau_koev.0002.b: "I must offer a part of myself."
 alau_koev.0002.c: "It beckons me in."
 alau_koev.0002.c.tt: "You walk into the flames and embrace them"
 alau_koev.0002.wound0: "The flames leave few marks"
 alau_koev.0002.wound1: "The flames leave some wounds"
 alau_koev.0002.wound2: "The flames leave many wounds"
 alau_koev.0002.wound3: "The flames leave harsh wounds"
 alau_koev.0002.d: "Surely they will not notice if I save myself from harm?"
 alau_koev.0002.d.success: "The priests fall for your deception"
 alau_koev.0002.d.success.t: "You save yourself from burning"
 alau_koev.0002.d.failure: "The priests notice your trickery"
 alau_koev.0002.d.failure.t: "You are expelled from the temple"
  
 alau_koev.0003.t: "On Offering to the Flame"
 alau_koev.0003.desc: "To offer the Great Flame one's own flesh is a pious deed, but as I turn the blade around in my hands, the decision becomes real. There is no real chance of escaping lasting injury this way, and to remove too little would be a pointless display, leaving me both despised and mangled. I could offer my leg or eye to the pyre if I wished to please the priests and their gods, but do I really have to offer anything?"
 alau_koev.0003.a: "I have two eyes. I can spare one for the fire."
 alau_koev.0003.b: "If I am to lose anything, let it be my leg."
 alau_koev.0003.c: "I cannot maul myself like this!"
 alau_koev.0003.wound1: "You spare yourself the worst"
 alau_koev.0003.wound2: "Your wounds are extensive"
  
 alau_koev.0004.t: "Returning from the Flames"
 alau_koev.0004.desc: "I step away from the Great Flame changed. No longer am I an outsider to the circles of the old priesthood; now, I am known across all lands that hold [alau_koev|E] in their hearts. The choice of how to negotiate the flame was my own, and it cannot be forgotten. The gods that lie within and beyond the Fire Gate have seen my actions, and I can only hope that the mortal world respects my choice."
 alau_koev.0004.a: "Time to return home."
