 gh_major_decisions.0002.desc: "Though we began as an Imperial Legion, those days have long since passed. As the memory of empire has faded, my realm has increasingly grown to appear no different than any other. With the formal dissolution of military rule over my lands, I now reign as an aristocrat, along the lines of old."
 gh_major_decisions.0002.a: "And now, the future."
